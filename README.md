Purpose: The purpose of this lab assignment is to:

Write an Android Application that demonstrates the fragments in the activity. The main activity should have two fragments. Design the Main activity with two buttons to display the fragments. When you open the app it should display the main activity page with two buttons. Clicking the button should display the corresponding fragments. Assign the text **Fragment1** to button1 and **Fragment2** to button2. 
When Fragment1 button is pressed it should display **Fragment one is selected**.
When Fragment2 button is pressed it should display **Fragment two is selected**.

Declare the String resources in strings.xml file to define the display messages of Fragment1 and Fragment2. (**Fragment one is selected, Fragment two is selected should be defined in strings.xml**)
